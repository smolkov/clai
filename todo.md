# Todo

Milestones and their order: [`implementation.md`](implementation.md).

## Foundation

- [x] `Cargo.toml`: dependencies, never-crash lints, release profile.
- [x] Error type with exit codes.
- [x] Command-line parsing of all commands in `spec/command.md`; unbuilt
      commands exit `1` with "not implemented yet".
- [x] Logging to `$XDG_STATE_HOME/clai/clai.log`, level from `CLAI_LOG`.
- [x] Unit tests for parsing, integration tests for exit codes and output.
- [x] `readme.md`, `todo.md`.
- [ ] Static musl build check (moved to Providers; target not installed).

## Configuration

- [x] Load user file, project file, `CLAI_MODEL` / `CLAI_THEME`; precedence.
- [x] Validation with file:line errors; project-file restrictions.
- [x] Permissions loading and merging (matching: Tools and permissions).
- [x] `[tui]` and `[themes]` validation (colours used by the TUI later).
- [x] Model references with short form.
- [x] API keys from env or `api_key_cmd`, never shown.
- [x] `clai models`, `--json`.
- [ ] Reload on file change (moved to Server and sessions).
- [ ] Glob syntax check of rule patterns (moved to Tools and permissions).
- [ ] Limit keys (need `spec/agent-loop.md`).

## Shell completion

- [x] `clai completion [SHELL]` with dynamic completion (`COMPLETE=<shell>`).
- [x] `--model` completes configured models; paths for `--config`, `-C`, `DIR`.
- [ ] Session names for `attach`, `kill`, `send` (Server and sessions).

## Next milestones

- [ ] TUI sessions and settings
- [ ] Commit (needs `spec/commit.md`)
